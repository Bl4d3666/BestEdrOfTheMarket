Best Edr Of The Market is an open-source lab designed to implement and understand, from a low-level perspective, the detection methods used by Endpoints Detection & Response security products and their workarounds. These techniques are mainly based on the exploitation of Windows NT's telemetric capabilities to dynamically analyze process behavior.
